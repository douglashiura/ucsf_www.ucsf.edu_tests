# ucsf www.ucsf.edu tests
This repo is a fork of @stopfstedt  tests for the UCSF install package (https://github.com/ucsf-drupal/ucsf_installprofile). If you’ve seen a default starter kit site (http://template1.ucsf.edu/) you should be able to follow the tests and how they relate.

If we want to convert the tests to automated tests as some point, using this structure should simplify the process.

Tests are “features”. /behat/features/main_navigation.feature to see an example of this.

If you write a test place @TBI above the scenario. That means “To  Be Implemented”. In other words, the test isn’t automated yet. When we automate we will remove the template.
